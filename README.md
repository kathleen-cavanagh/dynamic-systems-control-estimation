# dynamic-systems-control-estimation
Adventures in applying control and estimation techniques to dynamic systems.

This project is the continuation of work developed in 6.832 (Underactuated Robotics). Using simple systems such as a cart pole or acrobot (soon to come!), traditional control and estimation techniques are implemented to understand behavior and trade offs more intuitively. 

This is a personal project so please excuse the lack of unit-testing etc.
